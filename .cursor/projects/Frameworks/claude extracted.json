She's shared a ChatGPT conversation that produced what she considers a \"terrible\" and \"primitive\" version. Let me analyze what she needs:\n\nA detailed, high-touch onboarding plan with clear baton ownership\nA Gantt chart that varies by client type (strategic vs. standard)\nRecognition that clients are \"vulnerable\" or \"high priority\" in the first 1-90 days post-initiation\nThis needs to be much more comprehensive than what ChatGPT produced\n\nFrom the documents she shared, the key elements are:\n\nBDMs own revenue/client advocacy but shouldn't be project managers\nMike Langford is Senior Director of Customer Experience (SME/strategic sales support)\nCustomer Service handles onboarding post-contract\nTech support sets up clients on the system\nAutomation support handles Diagnexia automation and Prima (wet lab internal system)\nIntegration team is critical - most clients need digital integration/report repatriation\nCase Control and Pathologist Management need awareness of new sites\nStrategic accounts need \"white glove\" project management\nSmaller accounts are \"rinse and repeat\"\nCustomer Service lead should be on every call/email to know client temperature\n\nThe ChatGPT output had the right structure but Jenny says it's primitive. I need to make this:\n\nMore detailed with specific activities, not just bullet points\nInclude timing variations based on account type\nHave clear escalation paths\nShow dependencies clearly\nAddress the 1-90 day vulnerability period specifically\n\nLet me create a comprehensive React artifact that includes:\n\nA detailed 10-step framework with expandable detail\nA visual Gantt chart component that shows timeline variance by account type\nRACI matrix\nThe \"vulnerability\" scoring for the 1-90 day period\n\nI'll build this as an interactive React component that shows all of this information in a professional, usable format.Jenny, I can see the gaps in what ChatGPT produced - it's surface-level with no real operational depth. Let me build you something properly comprehensive.\nBefore I create the full artifact, let me confirm a few things to make sure I nail this:\nOn client tiering:\n\nAre you thinking three tiers (Strategic / Standard / Low-Touch) or just two (Strategic / Standard)?\nFor \"Strategic\" - is this defined by annual case volume thresholds, contract value, market influence, or a combination?\n\nOn the 1-90 day vulnerability period:\n3. Do you want explicit \"health check\" gates at Day 30, 60, 90 with defined criteria for escalation?\n4. Who owns the escalation if a client is flagged as \"at risk\" during this period - stays with CS, goes to Mike, or elevates to you?\nOn Integration involvement:\n5. You mentioned Integration needs to be aware from the start - do you want them on the initial BDM discovery call, or just notified immediately after if integration is flagged as needed?\nOn the Gantt:\n6. What's your typical timeline variance? E.g., Standard account = 4-6 weeks to go-live, Strategic = 8-12 weeks?\n7. Are there any hard dependencies on customer responsiveness you want built into the timeline assumptions?\nGive me these answers and I'll build you a proper operational playbook with:\n\nDetailed step-by-step with actual activities (not just headers)\nRACI matrix per step\nGantt with timeline variance by tier\n1-90 day vulnerability scoring framework\nEscalation triggers and ownership\nHandoff checklists between baton holders\ni think maybe 3 tiers might be good, we need to bring in if its low touch it might be that they are digital already set up we just plug and play and theyonly ever want to send digital slides maybe, yes strategic is contract amount, and influence ideally one of NHS englashs networks like north west london pathology for example.yes need health checks ontegration team notified by central chat immediatly after first call, then joinging a follow up scoping call for the etchnical sale spiece.yes those timelines look good for gannt, i really need owners in terms of when BDMs hand things off the customer service team ar ethe ground truth heart of all customer lifecycle they should manage 95 %1 Dec 2025Architected tiered onboarding framework with health checks and clear ownership handoffs.Jenny wants me to build a comprehensive onboarding framework with:\n\nThree tiers:\n\nStrategic: High contract value, influential accounts (like NHS England networks - NWLP example)\nStandard: Regular accounts with typical complexity\nLow-Touch: Digital-ready, plug-and-play, just sending digital slides\n\n\nHealth checks at 30/60/90 days during vulnerability period\nIntegration team: Notified via central chat after first BDM call, then joins follow-up scoping call for technical sales piece\nTimelines:\n\nLow-Touch: Probably fastest - maybe 2-3 weeks?\nStandard: 4-6 weeks\nStrategic: 8-12 weeks\n\n\nCustomer Service owns 95% of lifecycle - BDMs hand off early and stay as advocates only\n\nLet me build this out properly with:\n\nDetailed step-by-step framework for each tier\nRACI matrix\nGantt chart with timeline variance\n30/60/90 day health check framework\nClear handoff points\nEscalation triggers\n\nThis needs to be comprehensive and operational - not surface level like ChatGPT did.\nI'll create a React artifact with:\n\nAn interactive framework showing all steps with expandable details\nGantt chart visualization\nRACI matrix\nHealth check scoring system\nTier comparison\n\nLet me build this properly.Perfect, that gives me everything I need. Let me build this out properly - a comprehensive operational playbook, not the surface-level headers ChatGPT gave you.Diagnexia Service Implementation PlaybookInteractive artifact Synthesized tiered framework with ownership clarity and operational workflows.Great, I've created a comprehensive interactive playbook. Let me explain what's included and offer some additional refinements Jenny might want.I've built you a comprehensive interactive playbook. Let me walk you through what's now included:\nWhat this covers that ChatGPT missed:\n1. Three-Tier Classification with clear criteria - Strategic (NWLP-type networks, >£500k), Standard (typical single-site), and Low-Touch (digital-only plug-and-play)\n2. 12-Step Framework with proper operational depth for each step showing actual activities (not just headers), who does what, what gets produced, and the explicit handoff mechanism\n3. Integration involvement from Day 1 - they're notified immediately via Chat Space after the first BDM call, then join the Technical Scoping Call before contracting\n4. Clear baton ownership - BDM hands off to CS after Step 4 and becomes an advocate only. Customer Service owns 95% of the lifecycle as you wanted\n5. Gantt chart that adjusts by tier - Strategic runs 8-12 weeks, Standard 4-6 weeks, Low-Touch 2-3 weeks\n6. Health Checks at Day 30/60/90 with weighted scoring criteria and explicit escalation paths (30 → SX Lead, 60 → Mike, 90 → You)\n7. Full RACI matrix showing exactly who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed at each step\n8. Chat Space membership explicitly listed for Step 4 when it gets created\n\nA few things to refine:\n\nStrategic tier threshold - I used >£500k annual contract value. Want me to adjust that?\nLow-Touch scope - Should these skip the Technical Scoping Call entirely, or should Integration still do a quick 15-min validation call?\nEscalation ownership during health checks - I have it going CS Account Owner → SX Lead → Mike → You. Does that chain work?\nDo you want me to add a \"Strategic Account\" governance overlay with steering committee templates, RAID log structure, and QBR agendas?\nOk now from this can you build me out an interactive playbook for the customer service team...step by step, introduce yourself on X call, ensure they provide you with their SNOMED list, pass this list over to the automation team, make sure they provide you with their X record this in X etc etc2 Dec 2025Architected granular, interactive playbook spanning eight implementation phases.28sJenny wants me to build a detailed, step-by-step operational playbook specifically for the Customer Service team. This needs to be very granular and actionable - not high-level headers but actual instructions like:\n\n\"Introduce yourself on the welcome call\"\n\"Request their SNOMED list\"\n\"Pass this to automation team\"\n\"Record this in [system]\"\n\"Send this email template\"\n\"Chase if not received within X days\"\n\nThis is essentially an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for CS Implementation Leads to follow. It should be:\n\nInteractive - they can check things off\nStep-by-step with actual scripts/templates\nClear on what to record where\nClear on who to hand off to\nClear on timelines and chase cadences\nTier-aware (Strategic vs Standard vs Low-Touch)\n\nLet me think about the actual customer service journey from their perspective:\nPhase 1: Handover from BDM (Step 4 in main framework)\n\nReceive notification in Chat Space that contract is signed\nReview Client Handover document from BDM\nCreate/join dedicated client Chat Space\nAssign yourself as Implementation Lead\nReview tier classification\nPrepare for Welcome Call\n\nPhase 2: Welcome & Pre-Onboarding (Step 5)\n\nSchedule Welcome Call with customer\nOn the call:\n\nIntroduce yourself and your role\nExplain the onboarding journey\nSet expectations on timeline\nConfirm key contacts at customer side\nExplain what you need from them (homework)\n\n\nSend Welcome Pack email with:\n\nSNOMED Code Template\nIHC & Special Stains Template\nReporting Proforma Request\nManifest Templates\nShipping Instructions\nPortal User Access Form\nPortal Manual\n\n\nLog call in [system]\nSet homework deadline\nCreate chase schedule if not received\n\nI'll focus on the Questionnaire Workshop, tracking critical interactions and team coordination. I'll initiate homework follow-up, ensuring all prerequisites are met before scheduling the workshop. The goal is comprehensive information gathering across multiple internal teams. Key objectives include mapping SNOMED codes, understanding integration needs, and establishing clear communication channels with the customer. I'll meticulously document requirements and facilitate handoffs to specialized teams like Integration and Automation.\nFor Path Management, I'll consolidate all captured insights into a comprehensive Master Requirements Document, systematically logging every detail in our designated tracking system. This ensures a clear, traceable record of our discovery and design process.\nThe Design Review phase involves coordinating with the SX Lead to synthesize feasibility feedback from subject matter experts. I'll craft a Draft Service Design document that captures the collective insights and technical recommendations.\nDuring the Design Playback, I'll orchestrate a customer presentation that walks through the entire proposed workflow. The focus is on securing customer validation and establishing a concrete go-live timeline.\nTraining and Pilot phases will involve structured knowledge transfer, including portal training and controlled testing. I'll closely monitor pilot cases to validate our design and gather real-world performance insights.\nGo-Live represents the critical transition point, requiring intensive monitoring and rapid issue resolution. Daily stand-ups will ensure immediate responsiveness during the initial implementation period.\nThe BAU Transition focuses on sustainable long-term support, establishing a regular review cadence and implementing periodic health checks to ensure continued service excellence.\nI'll develop an interactive React component with granular navigation that includes:\n\nDetailed task breakdowns\nDynamic checklist functionality\nIntegrated communication templates\nAutomated handoff and tracking mechanisms\nReal-time timeline visualization\nProactive reminder systems\nLet me build you a proper operational SOP for the CS team - the kind of thing they can actually work from day-to-day.CS Implementation Lead PlaybookInteractive artifact Architected step-by-step customer service playbook with operational checkpoints.I've built a comprehensive CS Implementation Lead playbook. Let me summarize what's included and highlight the key operational details Jenny asked for.I've built you a proper operational playbook for the CS team. This is what they can actually work from day-to-day.

Let me analyze what she needs:\n\nA detailed, high-touch onboarding plan with clear baton ownership\nA Gantt chart that varies by client type (strategic vs. standard)\nRecognition that clients are \"vulnerable\" or \"high priority\" in the first 1-90 days post-initiation\nThis needs to be much more comprehensive than what ChatGPT produced\n\nFrom the documents she shared, the key elements are:\n\nBDMs own revenue/client advocacy but shouldn't be project managers\nMike Langford is Senior Director of Customer Experience (SME/strategic sales support)\nCustomer Service handles onboarding post-contract\nTech support sets up clients on the system\nAutomation support handles Diagnexia automation and Prima (wet lab internal system)\nIntegration team is critical - most clients need digital integration/report repatriation\nCase Control and Pathologist Management need awareness of new sites\nStrategic accounts need \"white glove\" project management\nSmaller accounts are \"rinse and repeat\"\nCustomer Service lead should be on every call/email to know client temperature\n\nThe ChatGPT output had the right structure but Jenny says it's primitive.

Let me build you something properly comprehensive.\nBefore I create the full artifact, let me confirm a few things to make sure I nail this:\nOn client tiering:\n\nAre you thinking three tiers (Strategic / Standard / Low-Touch) or just two (Strategic / Standard)?\nFor \"Strategic\" - is this defined by annual case volume thresholds, contract value, market influence, or a combination?\n\nOn the 1-90 day vulnerability period:\n3. Do you want explicit \"health check\" gates at Day 30, 60, 90 with defined criteria for escalation?\n4. Who owns the escalation if a client is flagged as \"at risk\" during this period - stays with CS, goes to Mike, or elevates to you?\nOn Integration involvement:\n5. You mentioned Integration needs to be aware from the start - do you want them on the initial BDM discovery call, or just notified immediately after if integration is flagged as needed?\nOn the Gantt:\n6. What's your typical timeline variance? E.g., Standard account = 4-6 weeks to go-live, Strategic = 8-12 weeks?\n7. Are there any hard dependencies on customer responsiveness you want built into the timeline assumptions?\nGive me these answers and I'll build you a proper operational playbook with:\n\nDetailed step-by-step with actual activities (not just headers)\nRACI matrix per step\nGantt with timeline variance by tier\n1-90 day vulnerability scoring framework\nEscalation triggers and ownership\nHandoff checklists between baton holders\ni think maybe 3 tiers might be good, we need to bring in if its low touch it might be that they are digital already set up we just plug and play and theyonly ever want to send digital slides maybe, yes strategic is contract amount, and influence ideally one of NHS englashs networks like north west london pathology for example.yes need health checks ontegration team notified by central chat immediatly after first call, then joinging a follow up scoping call for the etchnical sale spiece.yes those timelines look good for gannt, i really need owners in terms of when BDMs hand things off the customer service team ar ethe ground truth heart of all customer lifecycle they should manage 95 %1 Dec 2025Architected tiered onboarding framework with health checks and clear ownership handoffs.Jenny wants me to build a comprehensive onboarding framework with:\n\nThree tiers:\n\nStrategic: High contract value, influential accounts (like NHS England networks - NWLP example)\nStandard: Regular accounts with typical complexity\nLow-Touch: Digital-ready, plug-and-play, just sending digital slides\n\n\nHealth checks at 30/60/90 days during vulnerability period\nIntegration team: Notified via central chat after first BDM call, then joins follow-up scoping call for technical sales piece\nTimelines:\n\nLow-Touch: Probably fastest - maybe 2-3 weeks?\nStandard: 4-6 weeks\nStrategic: 8-12 weeks\n\n\nCustomer Service owns 95% of lifecycle - BDMs hand off early and stay as advocates only\n\nLet me build this out properly with:\n\nDetailed step-by-step framework for each tier\nRACI matrix\nGantt chart with timeline variance\n30/60/90 day health check framework\nClear handoff points\nEscalation triggers\n\nThis needs to be comprehensive and operational - not surface level like ChatGPT did.\nI'll create a React artifact with:\n\nAn interactive framework showing all steps with expandable details\nGantt chart visualization\nRACI matrix\nHealth check scoring system\nTier comparison\n\nLet me build this properly.Perfect, that gives me everything I need. Let me build this out properly - a comprehensive operational playbook, not the surface-level headers ChatGPT gave you.Diagnexia Service Implementation PlaybookInteractive artifact Synthesized tiered framework with ownership clarity and operational workflows.Great, I've created a comprehensive interactive playbook. Let me explain what's included and offer some additional refinements Jenny might want.I've built you a comprehensive interactive playbook. Let me walk you through what's now included:\nWhat this covers that ChatGPT missed:\n1. Three-Tier Classification with clear criteria - Strategic (NWLP-type networks, >£500k), Standard (typical single-site), and Low-Touch (digital-only plug-and-play)\n2. 12-Step Framework with proper operational depth for each step showing actual activities (not just headers), who does what, what gets produced, and the explicit handoff mechanism\n3. Integration involvement from Day 1 - they're notified immediately via Chat Space after the first BDM call, then join the Technical Scoping Call before contracting\n4. Clear baton ownership - BDM hands off to CS after Step 4 and becomes an advocate only. Customer Service owns 95% of the lifecycle as you wanted\n5. Gantt chart that adjusts by tier - Strategic runs 8-12 weeks, Standard 4-6 weeks, Low-Touch 2-3 weeks\n6. Health Checks at Day 30/60/90 with weighted scoring criteria and explicit escalation paths (30 → SX Lead, 60 → Mike, 90 → You)\n7. Full RACI matrix showing exactly who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed at each step\n8. Chat Space membership explicitly listed for Step 4 when it gets created\n\nA few things to refine:\n\nStrategic tier threshold - I used >£500k annual contract value. Want me to adjust that?\nLow-Touch scope - Should these skip the Technical Scoping Call entirely, or should Integration still do a quick 15-min validation call?\nEscalation ownership during health checks - I have it going CS Account Owner → SX Lead → Mike → You. Does that chain work?\nDo you want me to add a \"Strategic Account\" governance overlay with steering committee templates, RAID log structure, and QBR agendas?\nOk now from this can you build me out an interactive playbook for the customer service team...step by step, introduce yourself on X call, ensure they provide you with their SNOMED list, pass this list over to the automation team, make sure they provide you with their X record this in X etc etc2 Dec 2025Architected granular, interactive playbook spanning eight implementation phases.28sJenny wants me to build a detailed, step-by-step operational playbook specifically for the Customer Service team. This needs to be very granular and actionable - not high-level headers but actual instructions like:\n\n\"Introduce yourself on the welcome call\"\n\"Request their SNOMED list\"\n\"Pass this to automation team\"\n\"Record this in [system]\"\n\"Send this email template\"\n\"Chase if not received within X days\"\n\nThis is essentially an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for CS Implementation Leads to follow. It should be:\n\nInteractive - they can check things off\nStep-by-step with actual scripts/templates\nClear on what to record where\nClear on who to hand off to\nClear on timelines and chase cadences\nTier-aware (Strategic vs Standard vs Low-Touch)\n\nLet me think about the actual customer service journey from their perspective:\nPhase 1: Handover from BDM (Step 4 in main framework)\n\nReceive notification in Chat Space that contract is signed\nReview Client Handover document from BDM\nCreate/join dedicated client Chat Space\nAssign yourself as Implementation Lead\nReview tier classification\nPrepare for Welcome Call\n\nPhase 2: Welcome & Pre-Onboarding (Step 5)\n\nSchedule Welcome Call with customer\nOn the call:\n\nIntroduce yourself and your role\nExplain the onboarding journey\nSet expectations on timeline\nConfirm key contacts at customer side\nExplain what you need from them (homework)\n\n\nSend Welcome Pack email with:\n\nSNOMED Code Template\nIHC & Special Stains Template\nReporting Proforma Request\nManifest Templates\nShipping Instructions\nPortal User Access Form\nPortal Manual\n\n\nLog call in [system]\nSet homework deadline\nCreate chase schedule if not received\n\nI'll focus on the Questionnaire Workshop, tracking critical interactions and team coordination. I'll initiate homework follow-up, ensuring all prerequisites are met before scheduling the workshop. The goal is comprehensive information gathering across multiple internal teams. Key objectives include mapping SNOMED codes, understanding integration needs, and establishing clear communication channels with the customer. I'll meticulously document requirements and facilitate handoffs to specialized teams like Integration and Automation.\nFor Path Management, I'll consolidate all captured insights into a comprehensive Master Requirements Document, systematically logging every detail in our designated tracking system. This ensures a clear, traceable record of our discovery and design process.\nThe Design Review phase involves coordinating with the SX Lead to synthesize feasibility feedback from subject matter experts. I'll craft a Draft Service Design document that captures the collective insights and technical recommendations.\nDuring the Design Playback, I'll orchestrate a customer presentation that walks through the entire proposed workflow. The focus is on securing customer validation and establishing a concrete go-live timeline.\nTraining and Pilot phases will involve structured knowledge transfer, including portal training and controlled testing. I'll closely monitor pilot cases to validate our design and gather real-world performance insights.\nGo-Live represents the critical transition point, requiring intensive monitoring and rapid issue resolution. Daily stand-ups will ensure immediate responsiveness during the initial implementation period.\nThe BAU Transition focuses on sustainable long-term support, establishing a regular review cadence and implementing periodic health checks to ensure continued service excellence.\nI'll develop an interactive React component with granular navigation that includes:\n\nDetailed task breakdowns\nDynamic checklist functionality\nIntegrated communication templates\nAutomated handoff and tracking mechanisms\nReal-time timeline visualization\nProactive reminder systems\nLet me build you a proper operational SOP for the CS team - the kind of thing they can actually work from day-to-day.CS Implementation Lead PlaybookInteractive artifact Architected step-by-step customer service playbook with operational checkpoints.I've built a comprehensive CS Implementation Lead playbook. Let me summarize what's included and highlight the key operational details Jenny asked for.I've built you a proper operational playbook for the CS team. This is what they can actually work from day-to-day. Here's what's now included:\n9 Phases with granular task-level detail:\n\nHandover & Setup - Receiving the baton from BDM, creating Chat Space, who to add\nWelcome Call - Full call script, what to say, questions to ask, how to frame homework\nHomework Collection - Chase sequences, validation checks, handoff scripts to Automation/Integration\nQuestionnaire Workshop - Minute-by-minute agenda, who captures what, post-workshop handoffs\nInternal Design & Build - Coordinating SMEs, monitoring build progress\nDesign Playback - Customer sign-off process, exact scripts\nTraining & Pilot - Training agenda, dry-run test cases\nGo-Live & Hypercare - Day 1 actions, daily monitoring checklist\nBAU & Health Checks - Day 30/60/90 scoring criteria, escalation triggers\n\nFor each task, I've included:\n\nExactly what to do (step-by-step actions)\nWhat to say (scripts where relevant)\nWhere to record it (specific system/doc)\nWho to hand off to (with copy-paste handoff messages)\nEmail templates (click to view and copy)\nTier-specific variations (Strategic vs Standard vs Low-Touch)\nEscalation triggers\nCheckboxes to track completion\n\nKey handoffs explicitly scripted:\n\nSNOMED list → Automation Team (with exact Chat Space message)\nIntegration requirements → Integration Team\nReporting specs → Path Management\nRouting rules → Case Control\nLogistics → Lab Ops\n\nWant me to add anything specific? For example:\n\nMore email templates (specific chase sequences, specific scenarios)?\nIntegration with your actual system names (what's your tracker called, what's your CRM)?\nDecision trees for common problems (\"what to do if customer misses deadline\")?\nSLA timelines for internal handoffs (e.g., \"Automation must respond within 48h\")?\n Opus 4.5Claude is AI and can make mistakes.

She's shared a ChatGPT conversation that produced what she considers a \"terrible\" and \"primitive\" version. Let me analyze what she needs:\n\nA detailed, high-touch onboarding plan with clear baton ownership\nA Gantt chart that varies by client type (strategic vs. standard)\nRecognition that clients are \"vulnerable\" or \"high priority\" in the first 1-90 days post-initiation\nThis needs to be much more comprehensive than what ChatGPT produced\n\nFrom the documents she shared, the key elements are:\n\nBDMs own revenue/client advocacy but shouldn't be project managers\nMike Langford is Senior Director of Customer Experience (SME/strategic sales support)\nCustomer Service handles onboarding post-contract\nTech support sets up clients on the system\nAutomation support handles Diagnexia automation and Prima (wet lab internal system)\nIntegration team is critical - most clients need digital integration/report repatriation\nCase Control and Pathologist Management need awareness of new sites\nStrategic accounts need \"white glove\" project management\nSmaller accounts are \"rinse and repeat\"\nCustomer Service lead should be on every call/email to know client temperature\n\nThe ChatGPT output had the right structure but Jenny says it's primitive.

Let me build you something properly comprehensive.\nBefore I create the full artifact, let me confirm a few things to make sure I nail this:\nOn client tiering:\n\nAre you thinking three tiers (Strategic / Standard / Low-Touch) or just two (Strategic / Standard)?\nFor \"Strategic\" - is this defined by annual case volume thresholds, contract value, market influence, or a combination?\n\nOn the 1-90 day vulnerability period:\n3. Do you want explicit \"health check\" gates at Day 30, 60, 90 with defined criteria for escalation?\n4. Who owns the escalation if a client is flagged as \"at risk\" during this period - stays with CS, goes to Mike, or elevates to you?\nOn Integration involvement:\n5. You mentioned Integration needs to be aware from the start - do you want them on the initial BDM discovery call, or just notified immediately after if integration is flagged as needed?\nOn the Gantt:\n6. What's your typical timeline variance? E.g., Standard account = 4-6 weeks to go-live, Strategic = 8-12 weeks?\n7.

Let me build you something properly comprehensive.\nBefore I create the full artifact, let me confirm a few things to make sure I nail this:\nOn client tiering:\n\nAre you thinking three tiers (Strategic / Standard / Low-Touch) or just two (Strategic / Standard)?\nFor \"Strategic\" - is this defined by annual case volume thresholds, contract value, market influence, or a combination?\n\nOn the 1-90 day vulnerability period:\n3. Do you want explicit \"health check\" gates at Day 30, 60, 90 with defined criteria for escalation?\n4. Who owns the escalation if a client is flagged as \"at risk\" during this period - stays with CS, goes to Mike, or elevates to you?\nOn Integration involvement:\n5. You mentioned Integration needs to be aware from the start - do you want them on the initial BDM discovery call, or just notified immediately after if integration is flagged as needed?\nOn the Gantt:\n6. What's your typical timeline variance? E.g., Standard account = 4-6 weeks to go-live, Strategic = 8-12 weeks?\n7. Are there any hard dependencies on customer responsiveness you want built into the timeline assumptions?\nGive me these answers and I'll build you a proper operational playbook with:\n\nDetailed step-by-step with actual activities (not just headers)\nRACI matrix per step\nGantt with timeline variance by tier\n1-90 day vulnerability scoring framework\nEscalation triggers and ownership\nHandoff checklists between baton holders\ni think maybe 3 tiers might be good, we need to bring in if its low touch it might be that they are digital already set up we just plug and play and theyonly ever want to send digital slides maybe, yes strategic is contract amount, and influence ideally one of NHS englashs networks like north west london pathology for example.yes need health checks ontegration team notified by central chat immediatly after first call, then joinging a follow up scoping call for the etchnical sale spiece.yes those timelines look good for gannt, i really need owners in terms of when BDMs hand things off the customer service team ar ethe ground truth heart of all customer lifecycle they should manage 95 %1 Dec 2025Architected tiered onboarding framework with health checks and clear ownership handoffs.Jenny wants me to build a comprehensive onboarding framework with:\n\nThree tiers:\n\nStrategic: High contract value, influential accounts (like NHS England networks - NWLP example)\nStandard: Regular accounts with typical complexity\nLow-Touch: Digital-ready, plug-and-play, just sending digital slides\n\n\nHealth checks at 30/60/90 days during vulnerability period\nIntegration team: Notified via central chat after first BDM call, then joins follow-up scoping call for technical sales piece\nTimelines:\n\nLow-Touch: Probably fastest - maybe 2-3 weeks?\nStandard: 4-6 weeks\nStrategic: 8-12 weeks\n\n\nCustomer Service owns 95% of lifecycle - BDMs hand off early and stay as advocates only\n\nLet me build this out properly with:\n\nDetailed step-by-step framework for each tier\nRACI matrix\nGantt chart with timeline variance\n30/60/90 day health check framework\nClear handoff points\nEscalation triggers\n\nThis needs to be comprehensive and operational - not surface level like ChatGPT did.\nI'll create a React artifact with:\n\nAn interactive framework showing all steps with expandable details\nGantt chart visualization\nRACI matrix\nHealth check scoring system\nTier comparison\n\nLet me build this properly.Perfect, that gives me everything I need.

Let me explain what's included and offer some additional refinements Jenny might want.I've built you a comprehensive interactive playbook. Let me walk you through what's now included:\nWhat this covers that ChatGPT missed:\n1. Three-Tier Classification with clear criteria - Strategic (NWLP-type networks, >£500k), Standard (typical single-site), and Low-Touch (digital-only plug-and-play)\n2. 12-Step Framework with proper operational depth for each step showing actual activities (not just headers), who does what, what gets produced, and the explicit handoff mechanism\n3. Integration involvement from Day 1 - they're notified immediately via Chat Space after the first BDM call, then join the Technical Scoping Call before contracting\n4. Clear baton ownership - BDM hands off to CS after Step 4 and becomes an advocate only. Customer Service owns 95% of the lifecycle as you wanted\n5. Gantt chart that adjusts by tier - Strategic runs 8-12 weeks, Standard 4-6 weeks, Low-Touch 2-3 weeks\n6. Health Checks at Day 30/60/90 with weighted scoring criteria and explicit escalation paths (30 → SX Lead, 60 → Mike, 90 → You)\n7. Full RACI matrix showing exactly who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed at each step\n8. Chat Space membership explicitly listed for Step 4 when it gets created\n\nA few things to refine:\n\nStrategic tier threshold - I used >£500k annual contract value. Want me to adjust that?\nLow-Touch scope - Should these skip the Technical Scoping Call entirely, or should Integration still do a quick 15-min validation call?\nEscalation ownership during health checks - I have it going CS Account Owner → SX Lead → Mike → You. Does that chain work?\nDo you want me to add a \"Strategic Account\" governance overlay with steering committee templates, RAID log structure, and QBR agendas?\nOk now from this can you build me out an interactive playbook for the customer service team...step by step, introduce yourself on X call, ensure they provide you with their SNOMED list, pass this list over to the automation team, make sure they provide you with their X record this in X etc etc2 Dec 2025Architected granular, interactive playbook spanning eight implementation phases.28sJenny wants me to build a detailed, step-by-step operational playbook specifically for the Customer Service team.

I'll initiate homework follow-up, ensuring all prerequisites are met before scheduling the workshop. The goal is comprehensive information gathering across multiple internal teams. Key objectives include mapping SNOMED codes, understanding integration needs, and establishing clear communication channels with the customer. I'll meticulously document requirements and facilitate handoffs to specialized teams like Integration and Automation.\nFor Path Management, I'll consolidate all captured insights into a comprehensive Master Requirements Document, systematically logging every detail in our designated tracking system. This ensures a clear, traceable record of our discovery and design process.\nThe Design Review phase involves coordinating with the SX Lead to synthesize feasibility feedback from subject matter experts. I'll craft a Draft Service Design document that captures the collective insights and technical recommendations.\nDuring the Design Playback, I'll orchestrate a customer presentation that walks through the entire proposed workflow. The focus is on securing customer validation and establishing a concrete go-live timeline.\nTraining and Pilot phases will involve structured knowledge transfer, including portal training and controlled testing.

She's shared a ChatGPT conversation that produced what she considers a \"terrible\" and \"primitive\" version. Let me analyze what she needs:\n\nA detailed, high-touch onboarding plan with clear baton ownership\nA Gantt chart that varies by client type (strategic vs. standard)\nRecognition that clients are \"vulnerable\" or \"high priority\" in the first 1-90 days post-initiation\nThis needs to be much more comprehensive than what ChatGPT produced\n\nFrom the documents she shared, the key elements are:\n\nBDMs own revenue/client advocacy but shouldn't be project managers\nMike Langford is Senior Director of Customer Experience (SME/strategic sales support)\nCustomer Service handles onboarding post-contract\nTech support sets up clients on the system\nAutomation support handles Diagnexia automation and Prima (wet lab internal system)\nIntegration team is critical - most clients need digital integration/report repatriation\nCase Control and Pathologist Management need awareness of new sites\nStrategic accounts need \"white glove\" project management\nSmaller accounts are \"rinse and repeat\"\nCustomer Service lead should be on every call/email to know client temperature\n\nThe ChatGPT output had the right structure but Jenny says it's primitive. I need to make this:\n\nMore detailed with specific activities, not just bullet points\nInclude timing variations based on account type\nHave clear escalation paths\nShow dependencies clearly\nAddress the 1-90 day vulnerability period specifically\n\nLet me create a comprehensive React artifact that includes:\n\nA detailed 10-step framework with expandable detail\nA visual Gantt chart component that shows timeline variance by account type\nRACI matrix\nThe \"vulnerability\" scoring for the 1-90 day period\n\nI'll build this as an interactive React component that shows all of this information in a professional, usable format.Jenny, I can see the gaps in what ChatGPT produced - it's surface-level with no real operational depth. Let me build you something properly comprehensive.\nBefore I create the full artifact, let me confirm a few things to make sure I nail this:\nOn client tiering:\n\nAre you thinking three tiers (Strategic / Standard / Low-Touch) or just two (Strategic / Standard)?\nFor \"Strategic\" - is this defined by annual case volume thresholds, contract value, market influence, or a combination?\n\nOn the 1-90 day vulnerability period:\n3. Do you want explicit \"health check\" gates at Day 30, 60, 90 with defined criteria for escalation?\n4. Who owns the escalation if a client is flagged as \"at risk\" during this period - stays with CS, goes to Mike, or elevates to you?\nOn Integration involvement:\n5. You mentioned Integration needs to be aware from the start - do you want them on the initial BDM discovery call, or just notified immediately after if integration is flagged as needed?\nOn the Gantt:\n6. What's your typical timeline variance? E.g., Standard account = 4-6 weeks to go-live, Strategic = 8-12 weeks?\n7. Are there any hard dependencies on customer responsiveness you want built into the timeline assumptions?\nGive me these answers and I'll build you a proper operational playbook with:\n\nDetailed step-by-step with actual activities (not just headers)\nRACI matrix per step\nGantt with timeline variance by tier\n1-90 day vulnerability scoring framework\nEscalation triggers and ownership\nHandoff checklists between baton holders\ni think maybe 3 tiers might be good, we need to bring in if its low touch it might be that they are digital already set up we just plug and play and theyonly ever want to send digital slides maybe, yes strategic is contract amount, and influence ideally one of NHS englashs networks like north west london pathology for example.yes need health checks ontegration team notified by central chat immediatly after first call, then joinging a follow up scoping call for the etchnical sale spiece.yes those timelines look good for gannt, i really need owners in terms of when BDMs hand things off the customer service team ar ethe ground truth heart of all customer lifecycle they should manage 95 %1 Dec 2025Architected tiered onboarding framework with health checks and clear ownership handoffs.Jenny wants me to build a comprehensive onboarding framework with:\n\nThree tiers:\n\nStrategic: High contract value, influential accounts (like NHS England networks - NWLP example)\nStandard: Regular accounts with typical complexity\nLow-Touch: Digital-ready, plug-and-play, just sending digital slides\n\n\nHealth checks at 30/60/90 days during vulnerability period\nIntegration team: Notified via central chat after first BDM call, then joins follow-up scoping call for technical sales piece\nTimelines:\n\nLow-Touch: Probably fastest - maybe 2-3 weeks?\nStandard: 4-6 weeks\nStrategic: 8-12 weeks\n\n\nCustomer Service owns 95% of lifecycle - BDMs hand off early and stay as advocates only\n\nLet me build this out properly with:\n\nDetailed step-by-step framework for each tier\nRACI matrix\nGantt chart with timeline variance\n30/60/90 day health check framework\nClear handoff points\nEscalation triggers\n\nThis needs to be comprehensive and operational - not surface level like ChatGPT did.\nI'll create a React artifact with:\n\nAn interactive framework showing all steps with expandable details\nGantt chart visualization\nRACI matrix\nHealth check scoring system\nTier comparison\n\nLet me build this properly.Perfect, that gives me everything I need. Let me build this out properly - a comprehensive operational playbook, not the surface-level headers ChatGPT gave you.Diagnexia Service Implementation PlaybookInteractive artifact Synthesized tiered framework with ownership clarity and operational workflows.Great, I've created a comprehensive interactive playbook. Let me explain what's included and offer some additional refinements Jenny might want.I've built you a comprehensive interactive playbook. Let me walk you through what's now included:\nWhat this covers that ChatGPT missed:\n1. Three-Tier Classification with clear criteria - Strategic (NWLP-type networks, >£500k), Standard (typical single-site), and Low-Touch (digital-only plug-and-play)\n2. 12-Step Framework with proper operational depth for each step showing actual activities (not just headers), who does what, what gets produced, and the explicit handoff mechanism\n3. Integration involvement from Day 1 - they're notified immediately via Chat Space after the first BDM call, then join the Technical Scoping Call before contracting\n4. Clear baton ownership - BDM hands off to CS after Step 4 and becomes an advocate only. Customer Service owns 95% of the lifecycle as you wanted\n5. Gantt chart that adjusts by tier - Strategic runs 8-12 weeks, Standard 4-6 weeks, Low-Touch 2-3 weeks\n6. Health Checks at Day 30/60/90 with weighted scoring criteria and explicit escalation paths (30 → SX Lead, 60 → Mike, 90 → You)\n7. Full RACI matrix showing exactly who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed at each step\n8. Chat Space membership explicitly listed for Step 4 when it gets created\n\nA few things to refine:\n\nStrategic tier threshold - I used >£500k annual contract value. Want me to adjust that?\nLow-Touch scope - Should these skip the Technical Scoping Call entirely, or should Integration still do a quick 15-min validation call?\nEscalation ownership during health checks - I have it going CS Account Owner → SX Lead → Mike → You. Does that chain work?\nDo you want me to add a \"Strategic Account\" governance overlay with steering committee templates, RAID log structure, and QBR agendas?\nOk now from this can you build me out an interactive playbook for the customer service team...step by step, introduce yourself on X call, ensure they provide you with their SNOMED list, pass this list over to the automation team, make sure they provide you with their X record this in X etc etc2 Dec 2025Architected granular, interactive playbook spanning eight implementation phases.28sJenny wants me to build a detailed, step-by-step operational playbook specifically for the Customer Service team. This needs to be very granular and actionable - not high-level headers but actual instructions like:\n\n\"Introduce yourself on the welcome call\"\n\"Request their SNOMED list\"\n\"Pass this to automation team\"\n\"Record this in [system]\"\n\"Send this email template\"\n\"Chase if not received within X days\"\n\nThis is essentially an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for CS Implementation Leads to follow. It should be:\n\nInteractive - they can check things off\nStep-by-step with actual scripts/templates\nClear on what to record where\nClear on who to hand off to\nClear on timelines and chase cadences\nTier-aware (Strategic vs Standard vs Low-Touch)\n\nLet me think about the actual customer service journey from their perspective:\nPhase 1: Handover from BDM (Step 4 in main framework)\n\nReceive notification in Chat Space that contract is signed\nReview Client Handover document from BDM\nCreate/join dedicated client Chat Space\nAssign yourself as Implementation Lead\nReview tier classification\nPrepare for Welcome Call\n\nPhase 2: Welcome & Pre-Onboarding (Step 5)\n\nSchedule Welcome Call with customer\nOn the call:\n\nIntroduce yourself and your role\nExplain the onboarding journey\nSet expectations on timeline\nConfirm key contacts at customer side\nExplain what you need from them (homework)\n\n\nSend Welcome Pack email with:\n\nSNOMED Code Template\nIHC & Special Stains Template\nReporting Proforma Request\nManifest Templates\nShipping Instructions\nPortal User Access Form\nPortal Manual\n\n\nLog call in [system]\nSet homework deadline\nCreate chase schedule if not received\n\nI'll focus on the Questionnaire Workshop, tracking critical interactions and team coordination. I'll initiate homework follow-up, ensuring all prerequisites are met before scheduling the workshop. The goal is comprehensive information gathering across multiple internal teams. Key objectives include mapping SNOMED codes, understanding integration needs, and establishing clear communication channels with the customer. I'll meticulously document requirements and facilitate handoffs to specialized teams like Integration and Automation.\nFor Path Management, I'll consolidate all captured insights into a comprehensive Master Requirements Document, systematically logging every detail in our designated tracking system. This ensures a clear, traceable record of our discovery and design process.\nThe Design Review phase involves coordinating with the SX Lead to synthesize feasibility feedback from subject matter experts. I'll craft a Draft Service Design document that captures the collective insights and technical recommendations.\nDuring the Design Playback, I'll orchestrate a customer presentation that walks through the entire proposed workflow. The focus is on securing customer validation and establishing a concrete go-live timeline.\nTraining and Pilot phases will involve structured knowledge transfer, including portal training and controlled testing. I'll closely monitor pilot cases to validate our design and gather real-world performance insights.\nGo-Live represents the critical transition point, requiring intensive monitoring and rapid issue resolution. Daily stand-ups will ensure immediate responsiveness during the initial implementation period.\nThe BAU Transition focuses on sustainable long-term support, establishing a regular review cadence and implementing periodic health checks to ensure continued service excellence.\nI'll develop an interactive React component with granular navigation that includes:\n\nDetailed task breakdowns\nDynamic checklist functionality\nIntegrated communication templates\nAutomated handoff and tracking mechanisms\nReal-time timeline visualization\nProactive reminder systems\nLet me build you a proper operational SOP for the CS team - the kind of thing they can actually work from day-to-day.CS Implementation Lead PlaybookInteractive artifact Architected step-by-step customer service playbook with operational checkpoints.I've built a comprehensive CS Implementation Lead playbook. Let me summarize what's included and highlight the key operational details Jenny asked for.I've built you a proper operational playbook for the CS team. This is what they can actually work from day-to-day. Here's what's now included:\n9 Phases with granular task-level detail:\n\nHandover & Setup - Receiving the baton from BDM, creating Chat Space, who to add\nWelcome Call - Full call script, what to say, questions to ask, how to frame homework\nHomework Collection - Chase sequences, validation checks, handoff scripts to Automation/Integration\nQuestionnaire Workshop - Minute-by-minute agenda, who captures what, post-workshop handoffs\nInternal Design & Build - Coordinating SMEs, monitoring build progress\nDesign Playback - Customer sign-off process, exact scripts\nTraining & Pilot - Training agenda, dry-run test cases\nGo-Live & Hypercare - Day 1 actions, daily monitoring checklist\nBAU & Health Checks - Day 30/60/90 scoring criteria, escalation triggers\n\nFor each task, I've included:\n\nExactly what to do (step-by-step actions)\nWhat to say (scripts where relevant)\nWhere to record it (specific system/doc)\nWho to hand off to (with copy-paste handoff messages)\nEmail templates (click to view and copy)\nTier-specific variations (Strategic vs Standard vs Low-Touch)\nEscalation triggers\nCheckboxes to track completion\n\nKey handoffs explicitly scripted:\n\nSNOMED list → Automation Team (with exact Chat Space message)\nIntegration requirements → Integration Team\nReporting specs → Path Management\nRouting rules → Case Control\nLogistics → Lab Ops\n\nWant me to add anything specific? For example:\n\nMore email templates (specific chase sequences, specific scenarios)?\nIntegration with your actual system names (what's your tracker called, what's your CRM)?\nDecision trees for common problems (\"what to do if customer misses deadline\")?\nSLA timelines for internal handoffs (e.g., \"Automation must respond within 48h\")?",

Let me explain what's included and offer some additional refinements Jenny might want.I've built you a comprehensive interactive playbook. Let me walk you through what's now included:\nWhat this covers that ChatGPT missed:\n1. Three-Tier Classification with clear criteria - Strategic (NWLP-type networks, >£500k), Standard (typical single-site), and Low-Touch (digital-only plug-and-play)\n2. 12-Step Framework with proper operational depth for each step showing actual activities (not just headers), who does what, what gets produced, and the explicit handoff mechanism\n3. Integration involvement from Day 1 - they're notified immediately via Chat Space after the first BDM call, then join the Technical Scoping Call before contracting\n4. Clear baton ownership - BDM hands off to CS after Step 4 and becomes an advocate only. Customer Service owns 95% of the lifecycle as you wanted\n5. Gantt chart that adjusts by tier - Strategic runs 8-12 weeks, Standard 4-6 weeks, Low-Touch 2-3 weeks\n6. Health Checks at Day 30/60/90 with weighted scoring criteria and explicit escalation paths (30 → SX Lead, 60 → Mike, 90 → You)\n7. Full RACI matrix showing exactly who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed at each step\n8. Chat Space membership explicitly listed for Step 4 when it gets created\n\nA few things to refine:\n\nStrategic tier threshold - I used >£500k annual contract value. Want me to adjust that?\nLow-Touch scope - Should these skip the Technical Scoping Call entirely, or should Integration still do a quick 15-min validation call?\nEscalation ownership during health checks - I have it going CS Account Owner → SX Lead → Mike → You.

Let me walk you through what's now included:\nWhat this covers that ChatGPT missed:\n1. Three-Tier Classification with clear criteria - Strategic (NWLP-type networks, >£500k), Standard (typical single-site), and Low-Touch (digital-only plug-and-play)\n2. 12-Step Framework with proper operational depth for each step showing actual activities (not just headers), who does what, what gets produced, and the explicit handoff mechanism\n3. Integration involvement from Day 1 - they're notified immediately via Chat Space after the first BDM call, then join the Technical Scoping Call before contracting\n4. Clear baton ownership - BDM hands off to CS after Step 4 and becomes an advocate only. Customer Service owns 95% of the lifecycle as you wanted\n5. Gantt chart that adjusts by tier - Strategic runs 8-12 weeks, Standard 4-6 weeks, Low-Touch 2-3 weeks\n6. Health Checks at Day 30/60/90 with weighted scoring criteria and explicit escalation paths (30 → SX Lead, 60 → Mike, 90 → You)\n7. Full RACI matrix showing exactly who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed at each step\n8. Chat Space membership explicitly listed for Step 4 when it gets created\n\nA few things to refine:\n\nStrategic tier threshold - I used >£500k annual contract value. Want me to adjust that?\nLow-Touch scope - Should these skip the Technical Scoping Call entirely, or should Integration still do a quick 15-min validation call?\nEscalation ownership during health checks - I have it going CS Account Owner → SX Lead → Mike → You. Does that chain work?\nDo you want me to add a \"Strategic Account\" governance overlay with steering committee templates, RAID log structure, and QBR agendas?",

Integration involvement from Day 1 - they're notified immediately via Chat Space after the first BDM call, then join the Technical Scoping Call before contracting\n4. Clear baton ownership - BDM hands off to CS after Step 4 and becomes an advocate only. Customer Service owns 95% of the lifecycle as you wanted\n5. Gantt chart that adjusts by tier - Strategic runs 8-12 weeks, Standard 4-6 weeks, Low-Touch 2-3 weeks\n6. Health Checks at Day 30/60/90 with weighted scoring criteria and explicit escalation paths (30 → SX Lead, 60 → Mike, 90 → You)\n7. Full RACI matrix showing exactly who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed at each step\n8. Chat Space membership explicitly listed for Step 4 when it gets created\n\nA few things to refine:\n\nStrategic tier threshold - I used >£500k annual contract value. Want me to adjust that?\nLow-Touch scope - Should these skip the Technical Scoping Call entirely, or should Integration still do a quick 15-min validation call?\nEscalation ownership during health checks - I have it going CS Account Owner → SX Lead → Mike → You.

This needs to be very granular and actionable - not high-level headers but actual instructions like:\n\n\"Introduce yourself on the welcome call\"\n\"Request their SNOMED list\"\n\"Pass this to automation team\"\n\"Record this in [system]\"\n\"Send this email template\"\n\"Chase if not received within X days\"\n\nThis is essentially an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for CS Implementation Leads to follow. It should be:\n\nInteractive - they can check things off\nStep-by-step with actual scripts/templates\nClear on what to record where\nClear on who to hand off to\nClear on timelines and chase cadences\nTier-aware (Strategic vs Standard vs Low-Touch)\n\nLet me think about the actual customer service journey from their perspective:\nPhase 1: Handover from BDM (Step 4 in main framework)\n\nReceive notification in Chat Space that contract is signed\nReview Client Handover document from BDM\nCreate/join dedicated client Chat Space\nAssign yourself as Implementation Lead\nReview tier classification\nPrepare for Welcome Call\n\nPhase 2: Welcome & Pre-Onboarding (Step 5)\n\nSchedule Welcome Call with customer\nOn the call:\n\nIntroduce yourself and your role\nExplain the onboarding journey\nSet expectations on timeline\nConfirm key contacts at customer side\nExplain what you need from them (homework)\n\n\nSend Welcome Pack email with:\n\nSNOMED Code Template\nIHC & Special Stains Template\nReporting Proforma Request\nManifest Templates\nShipping Instructions\nPortal User Access Form\nPortal Manual\n\n\nLog call in [system]\nSet homework deadline\nCreate chase schedule if not received\n\nI'll focus on the Questionnaire Workshop, tracking critical interactions and team coordination. I'll initiate homework follow-up, ensuring all prerequisites are met before scheduling the workshop. The goal is comprehensive information gathering across multiple internal teams. Key objectives include mapping SNOMED codes, understanding integration needs, and establishing clear communication channels with the customer. I'll meticulously document requirements and facilitate handoffs to specialized teams like Integration and Automation.\nFor Path Management, I'll consolidate all captured insights into a comprehensive Master Requirements Document, systematically logging every detail in our designated tracking system. This ensures a clear, traceable record of our discovery and design process.\nThe Design Review phase involves coordinating with the SX Lead to synthesize feasibility feedback from subject matter experts. I'll craft a Draft Service Design document that captures the collective insights and technical recommendations.\nDuring the Design Playback, I'll orchestrate a customer presentation that walks through the entire proposed workflow. The focus is on securing customer validation and establishing a concrete go-live timeline.\nTraining and Pilot phases will involve structured knowledge transfer, including portal training and controlled testing. I'll closely monitor pilot cases to validate our design and gather real-world performance insights.\nGo-Live represents the critical transition point, requiring intensive monitoring and rapid issue resolution. Daily stand-ups will ensure immediate responsiveness during the initial implementation period.\nThe BAU Transition focuses on sustainable long-term support, establishing a regular review cadence and implementing periodic health checks to ensure continued service excellence.\nI'll develop an interactive React component with granular navigation that includes:\n\nDetailed task breakdowns\nDynamic checklist functionality\nIntegrated communication templates\nAutomated handoff and tracking mechanisms\nReal-time timeline visualization\nProactive reminder systems\nLet me build you a proper operational SOP for the CS team - the kind of thing they can actually work from day-to-day.CS Implementation Lead PlaybookInteractive artifact Architected step-by-step customer service playbook with operational checkpoints.I've built a comprehensive CS Implementation Lead playbook. Let me summarize what's included and highlight the key operational details Jenny asked for.I've built you a proper operational playbook for the CS team. This is what they can actually work from day-to-day. Here's what's now included:\n9 Phases with granular task-level detail:\n\nHandover & Setup - Receiving the baton from BDM, creating Chat Space, who to add\nWelcome Call - Full call script, what to say, questions to ask, how to frame homework\nHomework Collection - Chase sequences, validation checks, handoff scripts to Automation/Integration\nQuestionnaire Workshop - Minute-by-minute agenda, who captures what, post-workshop handoffs\nInternal Design & Build - Coordinating SMEs, monitoring build progress\nDesign Playback - Customer sign-off process, exact scripts\nTraining & Pilot - Training agenda, dry-run test cases\nGo-Live & Hypercare - Day 1 actions, daily monitoring checklist\nBAU & Health Checks - Day 30/60/90 scoring criteria, escalation triggers\n\nFor each task, I've included:\n\nExactly what to do (step-by-step actions)\nWhat to say (scripts where relevant)\nWhere to record it (specific system/doc)\nWho to hand off to (with copy-paste handoff messages)\nEmail templates (click to view and copy)\nTier-specific variations (Strategic vs Standard vs Low-Touch)\nEscalation triggers\nCheckboxes to track completion\n\nKey handoffs explicitly scripted:\n\nSNOMED list → Automation Team (with exact Chat Space message)\nIntegration requirements → Integration Team\nReporting specs → Path Management\nRouting rules → Case Control\nLogistics → Lab Ops\n\nWant me to add anything specific? For example:\n\nMore email templates (specific chase sequences, specific scenarios)?\nIntegration with your actual system names (what's your tracker called, what's your CRM)?\nDecision trees for common problems (\"what to do if customer misses deadline\")?\nSLA timelines for internal handoffs (e.g., \"Automation must respond within 48h\")?",

This needs to be very granular and actionable - not high-level headers but actual instructions like:\n\n\"Introduce yourself on the welcome call\"\n\"Request their SNOMED list\"\n\"Pass this to automation team\"\n\"Record this in [system]\"\n\"Send this email template\"\n\"Chase if not received within X days\"\n\nThis is essentially an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for CS Implementation Leads to follow. It should be:\n\nInteractive - they can check things off\nStep-by-step with actual scripts/templates\nClear on what to record where\nClear on who to hand off to\nClear on timelines and chase cadences\nTier-aware (Strategic vs Standard vs Low-Touch)\n\nLet me think about the actual customer service journey from their perspective:\nPhase 1: Handover from BDM (Step 4 in main framework)\n\nReceive notification in Chat Space that contract is signed\nReview Client Handover document from BDM\nCreate/join dedicated client Chat Space\nAssign yourself as Implementation Lead\nReview tier classification\nPrepare for Welcome Call\n\nPhase 2: Welcome & Pre-Onboarding (Step 5)\n\nSchedule Welcome Call with customer\nOn the call:\n\nIntroduce yourself and your role\nExplain the onboarding journey\nSet expectations on timeline\nConfirm key contacts at customer side\nExplain what you need from them (homework)\n\n\nSend Welcome Pack email with:\n\nSNOMED Code Template\nIHC & Special Stains Template\nReporting Proforma Request\nManifest Templates\nShipping Instructions\nPortal User Access Form\nPortal Manual\n\n\nLog call in [system]\nSet homework deadline\nCreate chase schedule if not received\n\nI'll focus on the Questionnaire Workshop, tracking critical interactions and team coordination. I'll initiate homework follow-up, ensuring all prerequisites are met before scheduling the workshop. The goal is comprehensive information gathering across multiple internal teams. Key objectives include mapping SNOMED codes, understanding integration needs, and establishing clear communication channels with the customer. I'll meticulously document requirements and facilitate handoffs to specialized teams like Integration and Automation.\nFor Path Management, I'll consolidate all captured insights into a comprehensive Master Requirements Document, systematically logging every detail in our designated tracking system. This ensures a clear, traceable record of our discovery and design process.\nThe Design Review phase involves coordinating with the SX Lead to synthesize feasibility feedback from subject matter experts. I'll craft a Draft Service Design document that captures the collective insights and technical recommendations.\nDuring the Design Playback, I'll orchestrate a customer presentation that walks through the entire proposed workflow. The focus is on securing customer validation and establishing a concrete go-live timeline.\nTraining and Pilot phases will involve structured knowledge transfer, including portal training and controlled testing. I'll closely monitor pilot cases to validate our design and gather real-world performance insights.\nGo-Live represents the critical transition point, requiring intensive monitoring and rapid issue resolution. Daily stand-ups will ensure immediate responsiveness during the initial implementation period.\nThe BAU Transition focuses on sustainable long-term support, establishing a regular review cadence and implementing periodic health checks to ensure continued service excellence.\nI'll develop an interactive React component with granular navigation that includes:\n\nDetailed task breakdowns\nDynamic checklist functionality\nIntegrated communication templates\nAutomated handoff and tracking mechanisms\nReal-time timeline visualization\nProactive reminder systems",

The business develoipment managers- enagge the client- scout the market landscope etc own the revneue coming in from each site, strategic sales support and SME- is Mike lamgford ou\n\nPASTED\n\nOk chat gpt did a terrible job can you help me, build out a very comprehensive step by step high touch onboarding plan and a gantt chart that varies by client to client depending on strategic impact, we should be seen as vunderable or high priority once they are 1-90 days post iniitiation.\n\nthis ppt is a very primitive version of the detailed onboarding framework i want you to publish for me and gantt chart\n\n1 Dec 2025\nArchitected comprehensive onboarding framework with tiered Gantt charts and vulnerability tracking.\n\n11s\n\nJenny is asking me to help her build a comprehensive onboarding framework and Gantt chart for Diagnexia. She's shared a ChatGPT conversation that produced what she considers a \"terrible\" and \"primitive\" version. Let me analyze what she needs:\n\nA detailed, high-touch onboarding plan with clear baton ownership\nA Gantt chart that varies by client type (strategic vs. standard)\nRecognition that clients are \"vulnerable\" or \"high priority\" in the first 1-90 days post-initiation\nThis needs to be much more comprehensive than what ChatGPT produced\n\nFrom the documents she shared, the key elements are:\n\nBDMs own revenue/client advocacy but shouldn't be project managers\nMike Langford is Senior Director of Customer Experience (SME/strategic sales support)\nCustomer Service handles onboarding post-contract\nTech support sets up clients on the system\nAutomation support handles Diagnexia automation and Prima (wet lab internal system)\nIntegration team is critical - most clients need digital integration/report repatriation\nCase Control and Pathologist Management need awareness of new sites\nStrategic accounts need \"white glove\" project management\nSmaller accounts are \"rinse and repeat\"\nCustomer Service lead should be on every call/email to know client temperature\n\nThe ChatGPT output had the right structure but Jenny says it's primitive. I need to make this:\n\nMore detailed with specific activities, not just bullet points\nInclude timing variations based on account type\nHave clear escalation paths\nShow dependencies clearly\nAddress the 1-90 day vulnerability period specifically\n\nLet me create a comprehensive React artifact that includes:\n\nA detailed 10-step framework with expandable detail\nA visual Gantt chart component that shows timeline variance by account type\nRACI matrix\nThe \"vulnerability\" scoring for the 1-90 day period\n\nI'll build this as an interactive React component that shows all of this information in a professional, usable format.\n\nJenny, I can see the gaps in what ChatGPT produced - it's surface-level with no real operational depth. Let me build you something properly comprehensive.\n\nBefore I create the full artifact, let me confirm a few things to make sure I nail this:\n\nOn client tiering:\n\nAre you thinking three tiers (Strategic / Standard / Low-Touch) or just two (Strategic / Standard)?\nFor \"Strategic\" - is this defined by annual case volume thresholds, contract value, market influence, or a combination?\n\nOn the 1-90 day vulnerability period: 3. Do you want explicit \"health check\" gates at Day 30, 60, 90 with defined criteria for escalation? 4. Who owns the escalation if a client is flagged as \"at risk\" during this period - stays with CS, goes to Mike, or elevates to you?\n\nOn Integration involvement: 5. You mentioned Integration needs to be aware from the start - do you want them on the initial BDM discovery call, or just notified immediately after if integration is flagged as needed?\n\nOn the Gantt: 6. What's your typical timeline variance? E.g., Standard account = 4-6 weeks to go-live, Strategic = 8-12 weeks? 7. Are there any hard dependencies on customer responsiveness you want built into the timeline assumptions?\n\nGive me these answers and I'll build you a proper operational playbook with:\n\nDetailed step-by-step with actual activities (not just headers)\nRACI matrix per step\nGantt with timeline variance by tier\n1-90 day vulnerability scoring framework\nEscalation triggers and ownership\nHandoff checklists between baton holders\n\ni think maybe 3 tiers might be good, we need to bring in if its low touch it might be that they are digital already set up we just plug and play and theyonly ever want to send digital slides maybe, yes strategic is contract amount, and influence ideally one of NHS englashs networks like north west london pathology for example.\n\nyes need health checks \n\nontegration team notified by central chat immediatly after first call, then joinging a follow up scoping call for the etchnical sale spiece.\n\nyes those timelines look good for gannt, i really need owners in terms of when BDMs hand things off the customer service team ar ethe ground truth heart of all customer lifecycle they should manage 95 %\n\n1 Dec 2025\nArchitected tiered onboarding framework with health checks and clear ownership handoffs.\n\nJenny wants me to build a comprehensive onboarding framework with:\n\nThree tiers:\nStrategic: High contract value, influential accounts (like NHS England networks - NWLP example)\nStandard: Regular accounts with typical complexity\nLow-Touch: Digital-ready, plug-and-play, just sending digital slides\nHealth checks at 30/60/90 days during vulnerability period\nIntegration team: Notified via central chat after first BDM call, then joins follow-up scoping call for technical sales piece\nTimelines:\nLow-Touch: Probably fastest - maybe 2-3 weeks?\nStandard: 4-6 weeks\nStrategic: 8-12 weeks\nCustomer Service owns 95% of lifecycle - BDMs hand off early and stay as advocates only\n\nLet me build this out properly with:\n\nDetailed step-by-step framework for each tier\nRACI matrix\nGantt chart with timeline variance\n30/60/90 day health check framework\nClear handoff points\nEscalation triggers\n\nThis needs to be comprehensive and operational - not surface level like ChatGPT did.\n\nI'll create a React artifact with:\n\nAn interactive framework showing all steps with expandable details\nGantt chart visualization\nRACI matrix\nHealth check scoring system\nTier comparison\n\nLet me build this properly.\n\nPerfect, that gives me everything I need. Let me build this out properly - a comprehensive operational playbook, not the surface-level headers ChatGPT gave you.\n\nDiagnexia Service Implementation Playbook\nInteractive artifact \nSynthesized tiered framework with ownership clarity and operational workflows.\n\nGreat, I've created a comprehensive interactive playbook. Let me explain what's included and offer some additional refinements Jenny might want.\n\nI've built you a comprehensive interactive playbook. Let me walk you through what's now included:\n\nWhat this covers that ChatGPT missed:\n\n1. Three-Tier Classification with clear criteria - Strategic (NWLP-type networks, >£500k), Standard (typical single-site), and Low-Touch (digital-only plug-and-play)\n\n2. 12-Step Framework with proper operational depth for each step showing actual activities (not just headers), who does what, what gets produced, and the explicit handoff mechanism\n\n3. Integration involvement from Day 1 - they're notified immediately via Chat Space after the first BDM call, then join the Technical Scoping Call before contracting\n\n4. Clear baton ownership - BDM hands off to CS after Step 4 and becomes an advocate only. Customer Service owns 95% of the lifecycle as you wanted\n\n5. Gantt chart that adjusts by tier - Strategic runs 8-12 weeks, Standard 4-6 weeks, Low-Touch 2-3 weeks\n\n6. Health Checks at Day 30/60/90 with weighted scoring criteria and explicit escalation paths (30 → SX Lead, 60 → Mike, 90 → You)\n\n7. Full RACI matrix showing exactly who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed at each step\n\n8. Chat Space membership explicitly listed for Step 4 when it gets created\n\nA few things to refine:\n\nStrategic tier threshold - I used >£500k annual contract value. Want me to adjust that?\nLow-Touch scope - Should these skip the Technical Scoping Call entirely, or should Integration still do a quick 15-min validation call?\nEscalation ownership during health checks - I have it going CS Account Owner → SX Lead → Mike → You. Does that chain work?\nDo you want me to add a \"Strategic Account\" governance overlay with steering committee templates, RAID log structure, and QBR agendas?\n\nOk now from this can you build me out an interactive playbook for the customer service team...step by step, introduce yourself on X call, ensure they provide you with their SNOMED list, pass this list over to the automation team, make sure they provide you with their X record this in X etc etc\n\n2 Dec 2025\nArchitected granular, interactive playbook spanning eight implementation phases.\n\n28s\n\nJenny wants me to build a detailed, step-by-step operational playbook specifically for the Customer Service team. This needs to be very granular and actionable - not high-level headers but actual instructions like:\n\n\"Introduce yourself on the welcome call\"\n\"Request their SNOMED list\"\n\"Pass this to automation team\"\n\"Record this in [system]\"\n\"Send this email template\"\n\"Chase if not received within X days\"\n\nThis is essentially an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for CS Implementation Leads to follow. It should be:\n\nInteractive - they can check things off\nStep-by-step with actual scripts/templates\nClear on what to record where\nClear on who to hand off to\nClear on timelines and chase cadences\nTier-aware (Strategic vs Standard vs Low-Touch)\n\nLet me think about the actual customer service journey from their perspective:\n\nPhase 1: Handover from BDM (Step 4 in main framework)\n\nReceive notification in Chat Space that contract is signed\nReview Client Handover document from BDM\nCreate/join dedicated client Chat Space\nAssign yourself as Implementation Lead\nReview tier classification\nPrepare for Welcome Call\n\nPhase 2: Welcome & Pre-Onboarding (Step 5)\n\nSchedule Welcome Call with customer\nOn the call:\nIntroduce yourself and your role\nExplain the onboarding journey\nSet expectations on timeline\nConfirm key contacts at customer side\nExplain what you need from them (homework)\nSend Welcome Pack email with:\nSNOMED Code Template\nIHC & Special Stains Template\nReporting Proforma Request\nManifest Templates\nShipping Instructions\nPortal User Access Form\nPortal Manual\nLog call in [system]\nSet homework deadline\nCreate chase schedule if not received\n\nI'll focus on the Questionnaire Workshop, tracking critical interactions and team coordination. I'll initiate homework follow-up, ensuring all prerequisites are met before scheduling the workshop. The goal is comprehensive information gathering across multiple internal teams. Key objectives include mapping SNOMED codes, understanding integration needs, and establishing clear communication channels with the customer. I'll meticulously document requirements and facilitate handoffs to specialized teams like Integration and Automation.\n\nFor Path Management, I'll consolidate all captured insights into a comprehensive Master Requirements Document, systematically logging every detail in our designated tracking system. This ensures a clear, traceable record of our discovery and design process.\n\nThe Design Review phase involves coordinating with the SX Lead to synthesize feasibility feedback from subject matter experts. I'll craft a Draft Service Design document that captures the collective insights and technical recommendations.\n\nDuring the Design Playback, I'll orchestrate a customer presentation that walks through the entire proposed workflow. The focus is on securing customer validation and establishing a concrete go-live timeline.\n\nTraining and Pilot phases will involve structured knowledge transfer, including portal training and controlled testing. I'll closely monitor pilot cases to validate our design and gather real-world performance insights.\n\nGo-Live represents the critical transition point, requiring intensive monitoring and rapid issue resolution. Daily stand-ups will ensure immediate responsiveness during the initial implementation period.\n\nThe BAU Transition focuses on sustainable long-term support, establishing a regular review cadence and implementing periodic health checks to ensure continued service excellence.\n\nI'll develop an interactive React component with granular navigation that includes:\n\nDetailed task breakdowns\nDynamic checklist functionality\nIntegrated communication templates\nAutomated handoff and tracking mechanisms\nReal-time timeline visualization\nProactive reminder systems\n\nLet me build you a proper operational SOP for the CS team - the kind of thing they can actually work from day-to-day.\n\nCS Implementation Lead Playbook\nInteractive artifact \nArchitected step-by-step customer service playbook with operational checkpoints.\n\nI've built a comprehensive CS Implementation Lead playbook. Let me summarize what's included and highlight the key operational details Jenny asked for.\n\nI've built you a proper operational playbook for the CS team. This is what they can actually work from day-to-day. Here's what's now included:\n\n9 Phases with granular task-level detail:\n\nHandover & Setup - Receiving the baton from BDM, creating Chat Space, who to add\nWelcome Call - Full call script, what to say, questions to ask, how to frame homework\nHomework Collection - Chase sequences, validation checks, handoff scripts to Automation/Integration\nQuestionnaire Workshop - Minute-by-minute agenda, who captures what, post-workshop handoffs\nInternal Design & Build - Coordinating SMEs, monitoring build progress\nDesign Playback - Customer sign-off process, exact scripts\nTraining & Pilot - Training agenda, dry-run test cases\nGo-Live & Hypercare - Day 1 actions, daily monitoring checklist\nBAU & Health Checks - Day 30/60/90 scoring criteria, escalation triggers\n\nFor each task, I've included:\n\nExactly what to do (step-by-step actions)\nWhat to say (scripts where relevant)\nWhere to record it (specific system/doc)\nWho to hand off to (with copy-paste handoff messages)\nEmail templates (click to view and copy)\nTier-specific variations (Strategic vs Standard vs Low-Touch)\nEscalation triggers\nCheckboxes to track completion\n\nKey handoffs explicitly scripted:\n\nSNOMED list → Automation Team (with exact Chat Space message)\nIntegration requirements → Integration Team\nReporting specs → Path Management\nRouting rules → Case Control\nLogistics → Lab Ops\n\nWant me to add anything specific? For example:\n\nMore email templates (specific chase sequences, specific scenarios)?\nIntegration with your actual system names (what's your tracker called, what's your CRM)?\nDecision trees for common problems (\"what to do if customer misses deadline\")?\nSLA timelines for internal handoffs (e.g., \"Automation must respond within 48h\")?\n\n\n\n\nOpus 4.5\nClaude is AI and can make mistakes.
